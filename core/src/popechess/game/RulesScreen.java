        "4. Either player can use one of their turns to move the Pope.\nThe Pope can move up, down, left, or right, one square at a time.\n The Pope may not move to the edge of the board,\nbut always stays one square away from the edge of the board.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "5. The Pope may not be moved backwards to the space that it just came from.\nThis means that the Pope has a maximum of three places it may be moved\nat any given time, except for its first move\n when four spots may be chosen.\n" +

        "6. The Pope does not prevent pieces from passing diagonally through it,\nor block other pieces in any way by itself. If there is a piece on one of the\nfour squares being protected by the Pope, then they will block other pieces\nthat attempt to move through that piece's square.\n" +
